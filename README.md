# **Cendol: Open Instruction-tuned Generative Large Language Models for Indonesian Languages**
Cendol is an open-source collection of fine-tuned generative large language models in Indonesian languages covering decoder-only and encoder-decoder transformer model architectures ranging in scale from 300 million to 13 billion parameters.
This is the code repository for Cendol. Links to the models and datasets can be found below.

**Overview**

IndoNLP developed and publicly released the Cendol family of large language models (LLMs), a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 560 million to 13 billion parameters. 

Cendol models cover two instruction-tuned versions: 
1.  Cendol-Instruct that is instruction-tuned on tasks-specific NLP data such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, machine translation, summarization, question answering, paraphrasing, etc
2.  Cendol-Chat that is continuously instruction-tuned from **Cendol-Instruct** on general knowledge and human-centric prompts.

Both Cendol-Instruct and Cendol-Chat are designed for a single-turn conversation. Cendol outperforms open-source multilingual and region-specific LLMs on most benchmarks we tested by a huge margin, with the smaller version (<1B parameters) of Cendol being highly competitive with other LLMs with 7B parameters.

**Model Developers**: IndoNLP

**Variations** 

Cendol comes from 2 base models (mT5 and LLaMA-2) each with a range of parameter sizes. mT5-based Cendol comes with 300M (mT5-small), 580M (mT5-base), 1.2B (mT5-large), 3.7B (mT5-XL), and 13B (mT5-XXL) models, while LLaMA-2-based Cendol comes with 7B (LLaMA2-7B) and 13B (LLaMA2-13B) models. Both variants come with Cendol-Instruct and Cendol-Chat variations. All 13B parameter models are tuned with LoRA, while others are fully fine-tuned.

In our paper, we showcase that adapting region-specific LLMs using LoRA is ineffective and inefficient, i.e., the 13B (mT5-XXL) Cendol models perform slightly worse than the 1.2B (mT5-large) Cendol models, while having 3x slower training time and 4x slower inference time. As an alternative to LoRA, we showcase the benefits of vocabulary substitution as an effective and efficient strategy for region-specific adaptation, where we improve the efficiency by **11.50%** and **18.71%** for training and inference times, respectively. 
In terms of evaluation performance, we also showcase that the model performs on par with the Cendol model trained with the original vocabulary. We also release the Indonesian vocabulary-adapted model denoted as `Indonesian-Vocab Instruct`.

**Input-Output**: Models input and output are text only.

## Intended Use
**Intended Use Cases** Cendol is intended for research use especially on Indonesian languages. Cendol models are intended for a single turn instruction, with Cendol-Instruct models can be used for task-specific instruction, while Cendol-Chat models can be used for general knowledge instruction.

**Out-of-scope Uses** Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws). Use in languages other than English and Indonesian languages. Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Licensing Agreement for Cendol.

## Evaluation Results

In this section, we report the results for the Cendol models on large-scale NLU and NLG benchmarks. For all the evaluations, we use our internal evaluations library.

## Ethical Considerations and Limitations
Cendol is a new technology that carries risks with its use. Testing conducted to date has been in Indonesian, and has not covered, nor could it cover all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Cendolâ€™s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Cendol, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.
